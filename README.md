# Human Computer Interaction Project - Fall 2023

To view progress made on a week-by-week basis for the HCI project, view the branches as they are associated with the .dflow, .caren, .sceneconfigure, and scripts that were developed to acheive the final product that was used for usability testing. 

File type definitions:
~ .dflow files are associated with the software used to create the interactions amongst modules that allowed for the integration of hardware in one software. 
~ .caren files are associated with the code needed to have the CAREN hardware (treadmill, platform, etc.) perform the way we needed it to for this project. 
~ .sceneconfigure files are associated with the virtual scene that was displayed to the user. 
~ script files are associated with the scripts that were within the DFlow software. These scripts (user interface, tutorial, and platform) were the primary items that allowed our mechanism to perform/behave in the desired manner.

General Project Description: 
The purpose of this project was to develop a unique rehabilitation paradigm that allowed for individuals who are recovering from an ankle sprain recieve more functional practice in complex walking environments (like on a hiking trial). To create this, we devleoped a game that involves targets that are projected onto the screen in front of them with a "interaction volume" that is associated with the bounds of the treadmill. While the user is walking at an average walking speed, the platform would incline/decline (pitch) or tilt to the left/right (roll) opposite to their position on the platform. For example, if the user moved to the front of the treadmill, the platform will pitch to create an incline and if the user were to move to the left then the platform would roll to the right. By creating this varying walking surface contexts, it places varying stresses onto the ankle that may be beneficial in improving the users confidence and rehabilitation from an ankle sprain.
